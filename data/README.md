This folder is intended to store sample input files and small datasets used for testing the Huffman compressor.

Do NOT add large binary files to the repository. Keep test files small (<= 1MB) or add instructions to fetch larger samples externally.

Examples:
- sample.txt (small text file)
- sample.bin (small binary sample)
